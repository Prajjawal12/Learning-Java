package Java_Basics;

//Packages in Java are used to group similar types of classes,interfaces and subpackages
//Packages are of two types:- User defined and In-built

/*
 * Java packages allows us to name the same class in different packages
 * It resolves naming collisions
 * Provides access protection
 */

//javac -d directory Package.java ---> We can send our classfile to the directory through this command
public class Package {
// packages can be imported using the import keyword
// import package.* --> This imports all the classes available in the package
// import package.classname ---> This imports only the class called classname into out java file  

// package can also have subpackages i.e a package within a package
